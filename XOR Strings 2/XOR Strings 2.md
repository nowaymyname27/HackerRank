The problem statement provides details about a buggy function that needs to be debugged. Since the function code isn't provided in the question, I'll assume you're going to provide it in the next step for debugging.

However, before we proceed, let's format the provided challenge into a README format:

# XOR of Two Strings

## Problem Description

Your task is to debug the existing code that computes the XOR of two given binary strings.

For two binary digits (either `0` or `1`), the XOR operation is defined as:
- `0 XOR 0` = `0`
- `0 XOR 1` = `1`
- `1 XOR 0` = `1`
- `1 XOR 1` = `0`

Given two strings consisting only of the digits `0` and `1`, find the XOR of these two strings.

**Note**: You can modify at most three lines in the given code, and you cannot add or remove lines from the code.

## Input Format

- The first line of the input contains the first string, `s`.
- The second line contains the second string, `t`.

### Constraints

- \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5\)
- \(|s| = |t|\)

## Output Format

Print the string obtained by the XOR of the two input strings in a single line.

## Sample Input

```
10101
00101
```

## Sample Output

```
10000
```

### Explanation

The XOR of the two strings `10101` and `00101` is:
```
1 XOR 0 = 1
0 XOR 0 = 0
1 XOR 1 = 0
0 XOR 0 = 0
1 XOR 1 = 0
```

Thus, the output is `10000`.
